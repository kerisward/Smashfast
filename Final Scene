Ripley and Furiosa come face to face at the top of the Rock Candy Mountain.  They share a snack of Twizzlers and Pixie Sticks. Just then the Alien jumps down to attack but Ripley pulls out a sniper rifle to fight back.  It only shoots pixie sticks and is useless.  In desperation, Furiosa throughs the Iphone at the Alien who catches it and is mesmerized by Candy Crush.  The Alien eyes are so fixed on the screen it starts to suck him into the phone as if to another dimension.  With the Alien gone the two feel safe and we think the game is won. HOWEVER:
	To live and WIN: Ripley asks to see the Iphone, pulls out a Sonic Screwdriver, points it at the Iphone to fix it.  This action creates a patch in the cosmic rip caused by the Tardis and the Universe is repaired.
	To DIE: Furiosa picks up the Iphone that has just sucked in the Alien and presses “Invite” to Ripley so that they can play.  Both are sucked into the phone and die.
