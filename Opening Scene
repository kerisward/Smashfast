The Tardis is spinning out of control in the cosmos
It explodes unexpectedly sending our entire universe both real and imagined into one cosmic paradox

Like waking up from a dream we see Furiosa from Mad Max opening up and standing to see the island of Jurassic Park for the first time.  Confused and fearful by the strange sounds and sights she is pulled to a long lost familiar ring of a free-standing NYC payphone.

It’s a little sticky and revolting, but she answers it anyway.
“Hello”

The voice on the other end is authoritative and insistent.  
“ You don’t know me but my name is Ripley. You need to move fast and collect as many weapons as possible.  There is a very nasty alien stalking you with acid for blood and a tail that will slice you in half” “ Get to me as fast as you can, there is a thing called an IPhone on the ground next to you...it will help you, bring it to me.” Look ahead - do you see a Rock Candy Mountain...I’m at the top - it is safe here!”
