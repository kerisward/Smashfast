She approached a meadow at the edge of the forest.  She sees Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama running to the doorway of the White House in the middle of the meadow.  They call to her for help just as a family of Raptors catch them and rip them to pieces.  As she approaches the White House she loses control when her segway is cut in half under her feet.  She falls to the side to look back and see a huge BuZZ SAW monster coming up from under the ground. She reached into the back back and finds a Nerf Supersoaker filled with water. 
To Live: she sprays the monster and it rusts and crumbles
To Die: She ignores the nerf gun and tries to use the shotgun again.	
To Die: Run away - The monster is too fast

She runs to the White House and up to the roof where a Pod Racer sits on the helipad. She gets on and races towards Rock Candy Mountain. Ripley calls her and she sets the IPhone on a safe hands free driving holder.  
	Ripley warns: “Be careful of the tunnel. Use the IPhone to locate me on the mountain.” 
Furiosa: “ I can’t it seems to be stuck on some stupid Candy Crush game!”
Ripley: “don’t touch it - I have a Sonic Screwdriver, that will fix it. Just keep moving the Alien is on your tail!”
Furiosa approaches the base of the Rock Candy Mountain and see’s the tunnel. She looks back to see the Alien chasing her.
