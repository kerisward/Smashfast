The Mountain is a towering formation of hard Rock Candy crystals with a tunnel at the base.  She gets off the Pod Racer but notices a Bazooka gun that she thinks will come in handy so she takes it and proceeds into the tunnel.  The tunnel quickly splits into two paths. The Blue crystal tunnel is covered in cheesy spider webs, being lactose intolerant and a bit arachnophobic she hesitates. The Red Crystal tunnel seems clear so she proceeds. Around the bend she hears a robotic voice saying “EXTERMINATE” and she is confronted by a Darlek.  
	To Live: She runs the other way to the Blue Crystal tunnel
	To Die: She shoots at the Darlek but all it shoots is Blow Pops, so it’s useless.
	To Die: She pulls out the IPhone to see if there is another path, but gets mesmerized by Candy Crush and gets exterminated.

She breaks through the Cheesy Spider webs and sees an elevator at the end of the tunnel.  She get’s in and heads to the top of the mountain not knowing that the Alien is hiding on the elevator roof.
