Furiosa picks up the IPhone, and a nearby backpack that has several weapons and some essentials. She looks at the IPhone and is mesmerized momentarily by the game Candy Crush. Her attention quickly shifts to the sky, because from overhead a pterodactyl approaches and she reached into her backpack to find a shotgun. 
To Live: She shoots it down
To Die: She Misses
To Die: Run away - she will get picked up and eaten.
After killing the pterodactyl she sees a strange looking machine called a Segway! Looking closely at it, it’s covered in blood and says “Property of Segway Steve”
She gets on the segway and proceeds towards the forest.
